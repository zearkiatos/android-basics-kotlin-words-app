# Words App

This folder contains the source code for the Words app codelab.


# Introduction
Words app allows you to select a letter and use Intents to navigate to an Activity that
presents a number of words starting with that letter. Each word can be looked up via a web search.

Words app contains a scrollable list of 26 letters A to Z in a RecyclerView. The orientation
of the RecyclerView can be changed between a vertical list or a grid of items.

The app demonstrates the use of Intents in two ways:
* to navigate inside an app by specifying an explicit destination, and,
* allowing Android to service the Intent using the apps and resources present on the device.

# Pre-requisites

* Able to create an Activity.
* Able to create a RecyclerView and supply it with data.
